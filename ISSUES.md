## How to Report an Issue

When you encounter a problem during testing, provide:

1. **What you did** (e.g., "Clicked Dashboard in nav menu")
2. **What you expected** (e.g., "Dashboard page should load")
3. **What happened** (e.g., "Got 404 page not found error")
4. **Screenshot/URL if possible**

I'll then investigate, find the root cause, and propose a fix for your review.
